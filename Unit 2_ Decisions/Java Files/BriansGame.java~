That's because if you notice, you take the value for the first turn inside the loop (the next line beneath this comment), but you don't actually ask the user for a new number inside the loop, that comes before it. So the last System.out line before the loop, where you ask the user for a number, that should be moves here inside the loop, so when the game restarts, it still asks for a new number too.
